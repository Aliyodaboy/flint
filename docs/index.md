## The Flint Programming Language

Flint is a new programming language which makes it easy to write robust smart contracts for the Ethereum platform.

The [project](https://github.com/franklinsch/flint) is still under active development. A preliminary introductory paper, [Writing Smart Contracts in Flint](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~fs2014/flint.pdf), is available online, along with the [Flint Programming Language Guide](https://franklinsch.gitbooks.io/flint/).
